Codes for our paper "Multiblock Partial Least Squares and Rank Aggregation: Applications to Detection of Bacteriophages Associated with Antimicrobial Resistance in the Presence of Potential Confounding Factors" are organized sequentially into the following folders.

01_PreprocessMetagenomicData outlines steps on handling and preprocessing metagenomic data downloaded from the CAMDA server.

02a_RefSeq and 02b_ResFinder goes over obtaining abundances from the RefSeq and ResFinder databases respectively for bacteriophages and resistomes.

03_DownstreamAnalysis describes the statistical methods implemented in our paper.
